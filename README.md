Solutions for [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
The task was to predict a house price using statistic and 79 features of houses. Here I used simple LinearRegression and RandomForestClassifier, but it is not the best solution yet.
Techniques I'm gonna try soon:
- gradient boosting
- neural networks

So far I did the following:
- prepared data(encoded strings, managed with NaNs)
- sent the first submission that is quite far from top 10% YET (;
